## Ninja PF configuration file( original located on /etc/pf.conf.backup ).## This file contains the main ruleset, which gets automatically loaded# at startup.  PF will not be automatically enabled, however.  Instead,# each component which utilizes PF is responsible for enabling and disabling# PF via -E and -X as documented in pfctl(8).  That will ensure that PF# is disabled only when the last enable reference is released.## Care must be taken to ensure that the main ruleset does not get flushed,# as the nested anchors rely on the anchor point defined here. In addition,# to the anchors loaded by this file, some system services would dynamically # insert anchors into the main ruleset. These anchors will be added only when# the system service is used and would removed on termination of the service.## See pf.conf(5) for syntax.## ICMP configureicmp_types = "{echoreq, echorep, unreach}"icmp6_types = "{echoreq, unreach, echorep, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137}"netbios_types = "{137,138,139}"interfaces = "{en0, en1, en2, en3, en4}"# Base policyset fingerprints "/etc/pf.os"set block-policy dropset state-policy if-boundset require-order yesset optimization aggressiveset ruleset-optimization noneset skip on lo0scrub in all fragment reassemble no-df min-ttl 64  max-mss 1440scrub out all random-idblock in log allpass out quick flags S/SA modulate state# Antispoofingantispoof quick for $interfaces inetantispoof quick for $interfaces inet6# More secure settingsblock in from urpf-failed to anyblock in quick on $interfaces from any to 255.255.255.255block in quick on $interfaces from any to 255.255.255.0# ICMP policyblock in inet proto icmp all icmp-type $icmp_types keep stateblock in inet6 proto icmp6 all icmp6-type $icmp6_types keep stateblock in on $interfaces proto {tcp,udp} from any to any port $netbios_types
